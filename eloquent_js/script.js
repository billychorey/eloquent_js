//to make special characters appear, use the backslash
// to make a new line, "here is \n a new line"
//skipped other examples of strings
//typeof operator produces a string naming the value you give it
//console.log(typeof 5) // returns a numbers
//console.log9typeof "" returns a string
//boolean true/false yes/no

//console.log(5>4) returns true
//!= not equal to, provide two values and will return a boolean t/function() {};
//logic && || and or 
// && both must be true


// ||or, one must be true... or both false returns false
// || value returns value to left if can be considered true
// || value returns right value if not
// I don't know what this is saying


//any fragment of code that produces a value is an expression
//that value can then be used by enclosing the expression
// a statement is a full sentence vs a fragment
//a program is a list of statements

//variables hold values
//variables are defined by keyword var
//after defined, it can be used as an expression


//var 5k = 15;
//console.log(5k/5); should return 3

//variable values can be changed at any time
//var hungry = "yes"
//console.log(hungry) returns yes
//hungry = "maybe"
//console.log(hungry) returns maybe

//can use and change as needed
// var myTirednessFromOneToTen = "8"
// myTirednessFromOneToTen = myTirednessFromOneToTen = 7
//console.log(myTirednessFromOneToTen)
//should return 15

//Math.max takes values and returns the greatest
//console.log(Math.max (5,4,65,345,2342)) probably goiung to return 2342
//Math.min is the opposite. 
//console.log (Math.min(1,54)+5432 probably going to choose the 1

//confirm can be boolean, ok is true cancel false
//prompt asks open question where user types a response
//conditional execution
// if and only if one condition... else run other response
// if skips a statement depending if boolean is true or false

//print all even numbers 0-12 
//console.log(0) etc

//loop allows repeat
//var number = 0
//while (number <=48) {
/*	console.log(number);
	number = number = 1;
}
//should return 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc tp 48



//do loop executes its body at least once and re evaluates after
the for loop is more comprehensive...
for a certain variable, while the value meets this parameter
do this equation and return the number

loops are broken when produce false or if there is a break
eg find first number greater than 6 and divisible by 3
for (var current = 6; ;current ++){if (current %3 ===0)}

CHAPTER 2 REVIEW QUESTIONS
#(+=#) is the hint

var # = 0;
while (# <= 7) {
  console.log(#;
  # = # + 1;
}
***************************************


fizzbuzz console.log all numbers 1-100
for divisible by 3 print fizz for 5 print buzz
for 3 and 5 fizz buzz

the hint says else if else chain
if %3 === 0 then fizz
if %5 === 0 then buzz 

for (var x=1) while x<100, x++ keep adding one plus one etc 
then as it hits divisible by 3 and 5 console.log fizz/buzz

else if 
else if
else

 ch3
 function is variable definition where value given is a function
 eg variable of tired equals the product of a million times a million
 var tired = function(x) {
	return 1000000 * 1000000;
 }
 there are parameters and a body which contains what statements are to be executed.

var sound = function () {
	console.log("train whistle")
}
sound(); returns train whistle
